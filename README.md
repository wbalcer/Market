This project is a simulation of a dynamic market environment where sellers, buyers, and a central bank interact under varying economic conditions. The simulation models the behavior of these entities with the goal of understanding market dynamics, price fluctuations, and the impacts of inflation and taxation policies. The primary components of the simulation are as follows:
Sellers

Sellers operate within a constrained supply of products per unit of time, which they offer on the open market. Their pricing decisions are influenced by three main factors:

    Production Costs: The baseline expense for creating the product.
    Economic Conditions: Inflation rates (decreasing the value of money over time) and applicable taxes.
    Profit Margins: The desired profit percentage added to the production cost.

The objective of sellers is to maximize their profits while adapting to changing market conditions.
Buyers

Buyers represent consumers with diverse needs, preferences, and financial resources, which fluctuate over time. Their behavior in the simulation is governed by the following principles:

    Needs and Priorities: Buyers seek products categorized into two groups:
        Essential goods: High-priority products they aim to purchase promptly.
        Luxury goods: Non-essential products they monitor but may delay purchasing.
    Economic Awareness: Buyers are informed about inflation trends.
    Price Sensitivity: As product prices increase, whether due to inflation or profit margins, their willingness to purchase declines.

Central Bank

The central bank oversees market activity, including product price trends and transaction volumes. It plays a regulatory role by:

    Setting Inflation Rates: Adjusting inflation to influence economic behavior.
    Tax Revenue Management: Maintaining consistent tax revenue by calculating it as the product of inflation and market turnover at the current inflation rate.

Simulation Objectives

The simulation aims to:

    Explore how sellers adjust prices to optimize profits while managing limited supply.
    Analyze buyer behavior in response to changing prices, inflation, and product availability.
    Study the central bank's role in stabilizing tax revenues and its impact on market equilibrium.
    Investigate the complex interactions between inflation, supply and demand, and market behavior.

This project provides insights into market dynamics, economic decision-making, and the effects of fiscal policies, making it a valuable tool for economists, policy-makers, and business strategists.
